// After create model \/
// With the Prisma schema defined, you will run migrations to create the actual tables in the database. 
// To generate and execute your first migration, run the following command in the terminal:
// $ npx prisma migrate dev --name "init"

//The User model has a few fields that you might expect, like id, email, password, etc. 
// It also has a one to many relationship with the Article model. 
// This means that a user can have many articles, but an article can only have one author. 
// For simplicity, the author relation is made optional, so it's still possible to create an article without an author.
// Now, to apply the changes to your database, run the migration command:
// npx prisma migrate dev --name "add-user-model"
